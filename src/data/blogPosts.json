This setup is ideal if you're running a main site with something like Next.js or WordPress on your root domain, and want to host your React-based admin panel separately but under the same roof.\n\nIn this step-by-step guide, we’ll show you exactly how to deploy your React app to:\n\nhttps://yourdomain.com/admin\n\nusing Hostinger’s shared hosting.",
